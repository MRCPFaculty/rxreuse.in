            <p class="lead">RxReuse is a non-profit initiative dedicated to bridging the gap between surplus medicines
                and patients in need.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to ensure that no medicine goes to waste while someone, somewhere, is struggling to afford
                their prescription.</p>

            <h3>How We Work</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Donors</strong> ship their unused, unexpired medicines to our warehouse.</li>
                <li><strong>Volunteers</strong> verify the quality and safety of every donation.</li>
                <li><strong>Patients</strong> apply for aid and receive medicines for free, paying only for shipping.
                </li>
            </ul>
